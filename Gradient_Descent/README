How to Run the Code:
To run the code for gradient descent, go to the folder '/code' and once inside,run the file 'main.R'.

What Happens When the Code is Run:
There, user will be prompted to enter which dataset to use(Life-expectancy or the Wine dataset).
Then, user will be prompted to enter which algorithm to use(normal gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent or mini- batch gradient descent).
Finally, user will be prompted to enter the learning rate- This must a number less than 0.1, or else the model will not work due to large
coefficients being generated. It is reccomended to enter a number from 0.00001 to 0.0001 for best results.

Outputs:
The algorithm will then begin iterating till it has converged on a minimum error. It will then print out the results to screen,and also
store this result in the folder '/outputs'- look in the folders inside(Life-Expectancy and Wine) for the corresponding results.
